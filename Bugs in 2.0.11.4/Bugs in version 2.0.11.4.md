# Bugs in version 2.0.11.4

We are aware of the following bugs in the latest version 2.0.11.4 of Simple waterfall. As part of our commitment to keep the visual up to date on the Microsoft Appsource, we had updated the simple waterfall visual to the latest Microsoft API for Power BI custom visuals. However, this update resulted in few bugs, and we are actively working on fixing them.
